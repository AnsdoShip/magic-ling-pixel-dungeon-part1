actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_rogue=Oh Goodness, you startled me! I haven't met a bandit from this place that still has his sanity, so you must be from the surface! If you're up to helping a stranger out, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_mage=Oh, hello %s! I heard there was some ruckus regarding you and the wizards institute? Oh never mind, I never liked those stick-in-the-muds anyway. If you're willing, I may have a task for you.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_ember=I'm looking for some _fresh embers_ from a newborn fire elemental. Elementals usually pop up when a summoning ritual isn't controlled, so just find some candles and a ritual site and I'm sure you can get one to pop up.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_berry=The old warden of this prison kept a _rotberry plant,_ and I'm after one of its seeds. The plant has probably gone wild by now though, so getting it to give up a seed might be tricky. Its garden should be somewhere around here. Try to _keep away from its vine lashers_ if you want to stay in one piece. Using fire might be tempting but please don't, you'll kill the plant and destroy its seeds.

actors.mobs.demonspawner.desc=This twisting amalgam of dwarven flesh is responsible for creating ripper demons from the dwarves that have died in this region.

Killing them may weaken it._

actors.mobs.dm100.name=DM-100
actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison.

actors.mobs.dm200.desc=The DM-200 is the second generation of dwarven 'defense machine', which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves and city below. They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!

The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.newdm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.
