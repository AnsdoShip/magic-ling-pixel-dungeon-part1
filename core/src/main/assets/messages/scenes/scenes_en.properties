scenes.guidescene.title=MLPD-Guide Book
scenes.guidescene.pages=7
scenes.guidescene.title_0=Write in front
scenes.guidescene.page_0=Welcome to Magic Ling Pixel Dungeon, this dungeon _is based on 0.92 Shatter_. \n\nThis is a must-read guide for beginners. \n\nIf you are playing a dungeon for the first time, be sure to read this guide first. \n\n_It will definitely benefit you in the future._
scenes.guidescene.title_1=About Difficulty
scenes.guidescene.page_1=It is true that it is difficult, but it is certainly not as difficult as the Twelve Trials of Hercules. \n\n In fact, its difficulty is considered to be controlled at an acceptable level. If you don't adapt or feel too difficult, it is probably because you are not familiar with its unique mechanics. You may need more detailed and flexible strategies and tactics You can't go anywhere in the dungeon, so the following content will help you well. \n\n Relax, although its requirements are a bit high, mortals don't have to pass the customs.
scenes.guidescene.title_2=Identify items
scenes.guidescene.page_2=The ignorant are fearless, but more often incompetent. \n\n _Potion colors and scroll runes_ and their effects are different in each dungeon, and knowledge remains in chaos until you use or identify them. \n\n The equipment in the dungeon may have absorbed power over a _long time_, but _may also wear down and even be cursed with a vicious curse_. Wearing a cursed piece of gear puts you at a disadvantage, but it also doesn't immediately pronounce your death. \n\n By means of _upgrade, identification, and exorcism_, you can easily avoid these risks and be prepared.
scenes.guidescene.title_3=Search Search
scenes.guidescene.page_3=The truth is often not there, especially to the unwary. \n\n Remember to stop at any time to rest or look around for the best solution. _rushing headlong into the enemy line might be brave, but not wise._ \n\n Don't forget to search, there are secret doors and traps in the dungeon, double click the magnifying glass button to discover their secrets_.
scenes.guidescene.title_4=Book Blessing
scenes.guidescene.page_4=In the dungeon, you always see various books. \n\n-They record some events and some horrific stories of _dungeons. _\n\n- Of course, if you want to use the power of books, this will require a little method. \n\n- Identify your books so you can read them. Different books will have different effects, I wish you a happy battle!
scenes.guidescene.title_5=Mission System
scenes.guidescene.page_5=In the dungeon, you can always meet various NPCs. \n\n- They will give you more or less quests. \n\n_Completing the task will give you certain rewards, which will allow you to gain more benefits in the subsequent adventures._
scenes.guidescene.title_6=Storm on the Water
scenes.guidescene.page_6=During your adventures, some patron saints are also protecting you. \n\nBut due to some other factors, some magically focused locations cannot affect you. \n\n_Attention, there are also some evil gods that are eyeing you!_
