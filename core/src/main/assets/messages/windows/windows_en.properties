windows.wndstory.sewers=This is a long-abandoned dungeon\n\nIt is said that this dungeon used to prosper before\n\nUntil her intervention, the dungeon became dangerous\n\nNow the inhabitants of this dungeon are all It is a monster infected by black magic\n\nYou are here now to find the truth of 300 years ago\n\nYou have to go all the way\n\nNow, it is impossible to go back.

windows.wndstory.sewersboss=This is inaccessible and the cold falls. \n\nBut this place is burned by its flames!

windows.wndstory.prison=An underground prison was established many years ago to house dangerous criminals. Due to its strict supervision and high security, prisoners from all over the surface are brought here to stand the test of time. \n\nBut before long, a dark miasma spread from below, twisting the minds of criminals and jailers. \n\nThe chaos that filled the prison made it completely out of order, so the city blocked the entire prison. Now no one knows what these creatures who have experienced countless deaths under the high wall will look like...\n\nNow it's a mess, and you can only kill everything.

windows.wndstory.prisonboss=If you do something bad, you will pay a price to match it. \n\nHope and despair are relative quantities\n\nThis is what she once said to Tengu\n\n As the world's first assassin, what is the role of Tengu? Is he still abiding by that contract? \n\nNo one knows this. \n\nHowever, you are not the one that Tengu is waiting for\n\n So if you want to go to the mine. Must find a way to get out of here first. \n\nAlthough Tengu has no grievances with you, the real key lies with Tengu, and you must work hard for this battle. \n\nHowever, are you a constant? \n\nIf yes, please show proof.

windows.wndstory.caves=This cave, extending from an abandoned prison, has long been empty. It's too deep and hard to develop for a city, and the dwarves are not interested in its extremely scarce minerals. There used to be a trading post here for both factions, but after the fall of the dwarven kingdom, only the ubiquitous gnolls and subterranean creatures still live here. \n\nBut this place has already been controlled by evil magic\n\nThis place is already very dangerous.

windows.wndstory.cavesboss=Origin, Development, Prosperity, Decay, Crisis, Riot, Conspiracy, Destruction\n\nThis is the development of this dwarf kingdom\n\nNow, the people of the dwarven kingdom seem to know that you are On the way,\n\nThey have a great gift for you, did you see that machine in front of you? \n\nThat's the DM, a giant mining machine in the kingdom of dwarves. \n\nHowever, this machine is only guarding here now. \n\nWhat is it waiting for? \n\nWhat are we doing here? \n\n According to the ancient books you saw at home, this place used to be a prosperous dwarf kingdom in the past. \n\nDM doesn't seem to find you, although it's not DM's fault, but you want to find the depths of the dungeon. \n\nFor this reason, you have to fight to the death against this machine. \n\nRemember, believe in yourself and survive!

windows.wndstory.icedead=Death is not our end, but our beginning. \n\n- At the moment of my fall, I was cut off from the world. Now, who can help me?

windows.wndstory.dkse=There is a diamond chest in front, try opening it?

windows.wndstory.city=Dwarven City was once the grandest dwarven city-state. In their heyday, the mechanized armies of the dwarves had succeeded in repelling the invasion of the Old Gods and their demonic armies. But there are also rumors that the victorious warriors brought corrupt seeds with them, and the victory of the dwarven kingdom was the beginning of its destruction. \n\nThe magic here is getting stronger and stronger, who is the mastermind behind the scenes?

windows.wndstory.cityboss=Fight all the way out of the siege\n\nAll the way to the Dwarf King's Chamber\n\nYou always know in your heart: "This is no longer the kingdom of dwarves, this is the paradise of the devil"\n\nThe kingdom of dwarves The mastermind behind this should know you're here\n\nAnd you know, this will be the first and last time you'll see the Dwarf King\n\nYou're ready, so please fight your way Bar!

windows.wndstory.halls=A long time ago this area was the outskirts of Dwarven City. The dwarves, who had triumphed in the war against the old gods, were powerless to take over and clear the area. As a result, the surviving demons gradually consolidated their control over this place, and now, this place is called the Devil's Hall. \n\nFew adventurers can go deep into such a place...

windows.wndstory.hallsboss=There is nothing here\n\nThere is no life here\n\nThis is the beginning of the beginning\n\nIt is really quiet here\n\nBut, you know, this is Trial! \n\nBut you have to face it, are you ready?

windows.wndstory.new=After defeating the ancient god Yog, it seems that everything has calmed down. \n\nBut you always feel that this matter will not end so quickly. \n\nStill, at least for now, everything is fine. You will descend to the palace of the ancient gods and take the final spoils and leave here in honor. \n\nHowever, in this dungeon, you have always held an attitude of belief. \n\nWell, yes, I'll be heading here again. But next time, there will be no monsters here. \n\nMLPD-The first half-end. \n\nPlease look forward to the second half - the truth.
